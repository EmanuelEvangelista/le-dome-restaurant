# Le Dôme — Restaurant Booking App

- Animations via Framer Motion; styling via Chakra UI and Bootstrap.

## Notes & Recommendations

- `express` and `mercadopago` are listed in `package.json` but there is no backend or payment integration included here — add and configure a separate server if you plan to use them.
- `src/utils/api.js` generates example availability; replace with a real availability API for production.
- Consider cleaning unused/duplicate dev deps (e.g., `jest` vs `vitest`) if not needed.
- Deploy the `dist/` folder to Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.
